## Description

### Overview

To provide additional network diagnostic possibilities on Industrial Edge Devices, an Edge App can be written with a Python backend and a simple Web UI to enable user interaction.

Current feature set:
* Ping
* DNS resolution and reverse lookup
* NTP
* OPC UA browsing
* HTTP requests (GET, POST and PUT)

### General Task

This guide shows how to build, install and use an Edge application with a Python-based (Flask) backend and a JavaScript-based (React) frontend. The backend is used to execute network diagnostic tools based on Python packages and expose these internally over an API, which the frontend can call.

## Requirements

### Prerequisites

* Access to an Industrial Edge Management System (IEM)
* Onboarded Industrial Edge Device on IEM
* Industrial Edge App Publisher
* Docker Environment

### Used components

* Industrial Edge Management OS V1.5.2-4
* Industrial Edge Management App V1.10.3
* Industrial Edge Virtual Device V1.11.0-4-a
* Industrial Edge App Publisher V1.6.5
* Docker Engine 20.10.22
* Docker Compose V2.4

## Installation

Please follow the [installation instructions](docs/Installation.md).

## Usage

To use the app, click on the app icon on your Edge Device or go to `https://<IED_IP>/conntest/`. Use the navigation bar on the top of the page to choose a tool and use the provided input dialogs to execute them.

### Ping

Type in the IP address or the domain name of the host you want to ping.

### DNS

Use the top input field to obtain IP address of a domain and the bottom input field to do the reverse.

### NTP

Type in the IP address or the domain name of the NTP server you want to contact.

### OPC UA

Type in the OPC UA connection URL (e.g. `opc.tcp://<IP>:<Port>`). If necessary, type in the username and password for OPC UA authentication as well. Click `Connect` to browse the OPC UA server.

Navigate the tree view using the mouse or keyboard. Selecting a node will show detailed information such as name, address, and value. Once browsed, the connection stays open until you click the `Disconnect` button.

### HTTP Request

Choose the type of HTTP request to send and fill out the headers or body if required. SSL certificate verification is disabled by default. Use the `Copy to Clipboard` button to copy the entire HTTP response.

The `headers` and `body` input fields should contain JSON formatted strings.

Example `headers`:

`{"Content-Type":"application/json"}`

Example `body`:

`{"data":"This is my data"}`
