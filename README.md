# Writing good how-to or tutorial

Before you start writing, read the following materials how to write good documentation (including how-tos).

* [Google Developer style guide](https://developers.google.com/style)
* [Technical writing Courses](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing)
* [Microsoft Writing Style Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cs-cz/style-guide/welcome/)

Then decide: Are you writing a tutorial or a how-to guide?

[Divio](https://documentation.divio.com/) explains the difference  (Note that this applies for software documentation for application developers)

* Tutorials are lessons that take the reader by the hand through a series of steps to complete a project of some kind. They are what your project needs in order to show a beginner that they can achieve something with it. https://documentation.divio.com/tutorials/
* How-to guides take the reader through the steps required to solve a real-world problem

Each have a different writing style. Tutorials must be bullet proof (no unexpected behavior) https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/

Note: Try to write the tutorials and how-tos as a standalone html page, ready to be generated using Static site generator [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/). When referencing code examples or files, use the full URL of the git repository. We want to reuse these how-tos and tutorials in Documentation website.

Don't explain concepts. [It gets in a way of action](https://documentation.divio.com/how-to-guides/#don-t-explain-concepts).  

Don't use HTML tags unless working with videos. And try to avoid using videos unless absolutely necessary. Don't upload videos to Git repository.

## Installation

How to install/run this application example? (i.e. how to deploy it to Industrial Edge device?) How to build this application? How to set up configurations in IE?

To keep the readme.md file as short as possible please add more detailed information in the docs folder.

* [Build application](docs/Installation.md#build-application)

## Usage

When the app is installed, how can I use it? Usually some basic UI description to prove that the app is working correctly.

## Documentation

Add links to documentation. Either on external URL or in the doc folder. Please use always link to a file not to a directory (it doesn't work with static site generator engines).

Add these links:
