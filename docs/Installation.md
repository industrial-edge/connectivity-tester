## Build the application

### Clone the image

- Clone or Download the source code to your engineering environment

### Build the Docker image

- Find the two files (in `src/backend_flask` and `src/frontend_react` respectively) named `Dockerfile.example`. These are example Dockerfiles that can be used to build the Docker images of the backend and the frontend. If you choose to use these, rename them both to `Dockerfile` before proceeding
- Open a console in the root folder (where the `docker-compose` file is)
- Use the `docker compose build` (replaces the older `docker-compose build`) command to create the Docker images
- These Docker images can now be used to build your app with the Industrial Edge App Publisher
- `docker images | grep conntest` can be used to check for the images

## Upload the app to the Industrial Edge Management

Please find below a short description how to publish your application in your IEM. For more detailed information, please see the section for [uploading apps to the IEM](https://github.com/industrial-edge/upload-app-to-iem).

### Connect your Industrial Edge App Publisher

- Connect your Industrial Edge App Publisher to your Docker engine
- Connect your Industrial Edge App Publisher to your Industrial Edge Management System

### Upload the app using the Industrial Edge App Publisher

- Create a new application using the Industrial Edge App Publisher
- You may use the provided [icon](/docs/graphics/conntest_edge.png)
- Add a new app version
- Import the [docker-compose](../docker-compose.yml) file using the `Import YAML` button
- The warning `Build (services >> ...) is not supported` can be ignored
- Next to the `conntest_frontend` service, go to `Edit`:

- `Start Upload` to transfer the app to the Industrial Edge Management
- Further information about using the Industrial Edge App Publisher can be found in the [IE Documentation](https://docs.eu1.edge.siemens.cloud/operator/index.html)
- Install the app on an Edge Device and follow the [usage instructions](/README.md#usage) on the main page of this guide
